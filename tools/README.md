# This App - Tools

A bunch of tools to ease creating environments, pipelines, and all that shit

## Initializing the stack

Use the script to create keys, certs, and the whole shebang

        ./initialize-stack -r eu-west-1 --external-domain-name thisapp-lab.itcant.be --internal-domain-name  thisapp-lab --profile wakaru --project thisapp --environment lab

From this you have to store the password and the certificates in a safe place,
up to you where this could be.
